  # Payment Terms
subquestion: |
    The total cost of the project is ${currency(total_cost)}<br/>
    DBJ will cover ${currency(DBJ)} which leaves your total contribution at ${currency(contribution)}<br/>
    The downpayment of ${currency(downpayment)} is due on ${deposit_date.plus(days=90)} 
    
    
    ### Early payment discounts
    Settle early and benefit from early payment discounts
    
    
    * 10% discount if settled by ${deposit_date.plus(days=30)} 
    <br/>This would reduce your total contribution to ${currency(discount_10)}
    
    
    * 7% discount if settled by ${deposit_date.plus(days=45)}
    <br/>This would reduce your total contribution to ${currency(discount_07)}
    
    
    * 5% discount if settled by ${deposit_date.plus(days=60)}
    <br/>This would reduce your total contribution to ${currency(discount_05)}
    
    
    Otherwise the total contribution remains ${currency(contribution)}
